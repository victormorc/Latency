# Latency
This project measures the latency in several periodic tasks running in a Linux distribution.
The IPC mechanism used are "named sockets".
The result is a ".csv" file with the information produced.

There is a script in python to decode the information in the ".csv" file. The script should
report to the user some values about the periodic task to the user.
